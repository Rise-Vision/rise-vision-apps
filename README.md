==============


## Introduction

Rise Vision Apps is our apps launcher built with AngularJS.

Project Name works in conjunction with [Rise Vision](http://www.risevision.com), the [digital signage management application](http://rva.risevision.com/) that runs on [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com).

At this time Chrome is the only browser that this project and Rise Vision supports.

## Built With
- *[NPM](https://www.npmjs.org/)*
- *[AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/)*
- *[Bower](http://bower.io/)*
- *[Gulp.js](http://gulpjs.com/)*
- *[Common-Style](http://rise-vision.github.io/style-guide/)*
- *[JQuery](http://jquery.com/)*

## Development

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation

* install npm

* clone the repo using Git to your local:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/rise-vision-app-launcher.git
```

* install all javascript libs such as gulp
```bash
npm install
```

* download components with bower
```bash
bower install
```

### Run Local

* under the root directory run gulp default task which will build and watch directories for changes
so building and reloading the browser after a change
```bash
gulp
```

* If browser hasn't opened, you can open it on http://localhost:8000

### Staging summary

When pushing changes to chore/fix/feature branches, an optional staging environment can be indicated at the end of the commit message. The format is [stage-x], with x ranging from 0 to 9 (defaulting to 0, in case it's not provided).

#### Staging Assignments by Team

| Stage | Team |
---|---
| apps-stage-0 |	Reserved - CCI |
| apps-stage-1 |	Apps |
| apps-stage-2 |	Apps |
| apps-stage-3 |	Apps |
| apps-stage-4 |	Apps |
| apps-stage-5 |	Apps |
| apps-stage-6 |	Delivery |
| apps-stage-7 |	Delivery |
| apps-stage-8 |	Creative |
| apps-stage-9 |	Creative |

#### Check which Stage is in Use

In order to check which staging environment is not currently being used, ```./currently-staged.sh``` can be ran in the root directory of the repository. The command's output is:

```
This command will show which branch has the latest commit referencing a given staging environment.
If a staging environment is not listed, it means it is not currently in use by any active branch.
Warning: this command will not show information about stage-0, unless it appears in the commit message
If you have not ran git pull/git fetch in a while, you may want to run: git fetch --prune

[stage-3] - 2017-12-13 15:31:54 -0300 - Commit user 1           - chore/branch-name
[stage-2] - 2017-12-12 17:22:15 -0300 - Commit user 2           - release/branch-name

```

Because of the way git works (mainly, references to remote repositories), it's important to have an up to date copy of the repository. The proposed command, ```git fetch --prune```, will retrieve the latest branches from GitHub and remove no longer existing references to branches. It will NOT remove local branches and it will not merge into working copies, which means unless you are doing something really specific with your repository, it's safe to run.

## Restoring Jenkins company

In case the Jenkins Company gets removed, which causes all e2e tests to fail, the steps to recreate it are:

- Login with jenkins@risevision.com
- Create a new company
- Subscribe to a plan (any plan would do). Not a trial, a renewable Subscription. This needs to be done as jenkins@risevision.com
- Go to Company Settings and uncheck *"Share Company Plan‚Äù*
- Create an empty presentation named *TEST_E2E_PRESENTATION*
- In Storage, upload an image file named *logo.gif*
- In Storage, create a folder named *E2E_TEST_FOLDER*

Additionally the _Company Size_, _Industry_ and _User Role_ fields need to be filled for the newly created company. This can be done from Company Settings (size and industry) and User Settings (role) by any user with access to this company. In case this is not done, two weeks after the company is created the `jenkins@risevision.com` user will be prompted to complete ICP information. This is not handled automatically by the tests and will cause them to fail.
